                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <div class="summary-content">
                        <p>Max1M (short for Max-a-Million) is a personal project I started with the goal of creating my own AI companion which something I’ve dreamed of making for as long as we've had Siri on our IPhones. It’s designed to be an digital assistant like an Amazon Alexa or Apple's Siri but with a face that look back at you as it talks back and a much more vibrant personality that adapts with me. In other words, bringing a lot more personality to robotic virtual assitants.<br><br> 
                            The plan is for Max to sit on a screen, which can either be on a personal computer or in my case a monitor mounted on a wall, follow who ever is talking with his eyes, and respond in real time by reacting to audio and movement, and later developing its own voice and personality. I want Max to eventually be fully capable of replacing my Amazon Alexa in terms of interactions and control over smart home products.<br><br>
                            The name comes from a mix of things. “Max” represents my goal of reaching the max of my potential, and “a-Million” adds a kind of futuristic charm that felt right for a project like this. Like how a character in a show might name their latest invention the incinerator 2000. A big number following the name to give it some power. It was exactly the kind of scheesy charm I was looking for for this digital buddy.<br><br> 
                            In this case, 1,000,000 felt like a big enough number for a project that's supposed to be about breaking my own expectations and pushing my liments. I also like the idea of a million being a lot of something, like a million stars to see, or a million grains of sand to wander, amillion possibilities to explore. It gives the name a sense of wonder and possibility, which is what I hope this project will inspire in others.
                            <!-- The project is still in its early stages, but I’m excited to see where it goes. I hope to continue developing Max1M into a fully functional AI companion that can help people with their daily tasks, provide entertainment, and even become a friend. I believe that AI companions have the potential to change the way we interact with technology and each other, and I’m excited to be a part of that change. -->

Light sources light up caves and dark structures, but if an area is too dark, the light won't illuminate everything. This creates a mechanic where the player can see that there is light in the distance, but must get closer to see what the light covers.</p>

Since I'm not exactly an artist I used photo references of me and videos of me running to better capture the animations for the player character. I found it particularly fun tweaking the small details of the animation frames to make as smooth of an animation as possible, such as how before the running animation loop starts playing there is a frame where the character leans forward. Unfortunately, the running animation came near the very end of the project so it was rather rushed.</p>

If you look closely at the text file, you'll see it's made up of tons of bracket squares '[ ]' that make up a grid. The filled in grid spaces make up an image of the stage.</p>

Each different character that occupies a space correlates to a different block sprite to render in that space. The game first reads the file to know where to place each block and what kind. To save resources, the game creates a new, temporary image composed of all needed blocks that becomes the stage we see. This image shows how the same part of the level looks both in the map file and in game.</p>
