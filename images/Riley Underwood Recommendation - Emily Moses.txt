I am pleased to recommend Riley as he embarks on his career in software development. Though early in his journey, Riley has already demonstrated the qualities that make for a great developer: creativity, dedication, and a strong work ethic. His passion for learning is evident in his willingness to take on new challenges, and I have no doubt that he will quickly adapt and grow in a professional development environment.

Beyond his technical potential, Riley is a fantastic person to work with. He is kind, collaborative, and has a great sense of humor—qualities that make him a positive presence in any team setting. His ability to juggle multiple jobs while pursuing his goals speaks to his perseverance and determination.

I believe Riley would be an asset to any software development team. He approaches problems with a can-do attitude, is eager to learn from those around him, and brings a creative perspective to his work. I have no doubt that, given the opportunity, he will excel and contribute meaningfully to any project he takes on.

Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss Riley further—I’d be happy to elaborate on why I believe he has a bright future in software development.

Best,

Emily Moses
