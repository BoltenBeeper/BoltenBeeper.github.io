To Whomever it may concern,

I am so honored to have this opportunity to recommend to you Riley Underwood.  I had the pleasure of being a coach in the IT Practicum class he took his Junior year of high school (2019-2020).  Riley is a diligent, responsible, observant and creative young man.

Riley built a computer secured locking cabinet that could charge chromebooks.  He worked with a team of three other students to design, build, code, test and troubleshoot.  Riley also wrote a side-scroller video game.  He and his peers collaborated to accomplish complex and difficult solutions to mechanical, electrical and computer programming problems.

I really appreciated Riley’s maturity and awareness.  He demonstrated a strong work ethic combined with a strong awareness of others.  Riley was considerate of the needs of his peers and was always quick to offer assistance.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Riley Underwood.  He has demonstrated both maturity and capability with scholastic, technical and organizational endeavours. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
