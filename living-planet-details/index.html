                        <p>Living Planet is a platforming game built from scratch using my own engine, art, animation, music, and level design format. This game only ever reached the demo phase for my highschool final project but I always saw myself coming back to this game as there was so much potential and story telling I wanted to do with it.<br>
                            What makes me especially proud of this project, despite only being a demo, is that everything from the engine, to the way the levels are rendered, to the lighting all came from my brain. I didn't follow a single tutorial, start from a partially made game, or use an external engine. It was all thought up and developed by me.<br>
                            I was heavily inspired to make this game after hearing a album bu Kid2Will on Spotify by the same name as this game. The album sparked my creativity so hard that I actually reached out to Kid2Will to ask for permission to use his tracks in the game to which he agreed.<br>
                            In the current previews of the game (available via my link to the google drive) two of his songs can be heard. One on the title screen, the other on the second, test level shown in one of the game play videos. The other song in the game, used for the first level, was made by me.<br>
                            Now, the game stands as a reminder to me of what I am capable of when given room to explore my creativity and relate my other passions in life in a way that helps me fully realise the world in my head.</p>

Light sources light up caves and dark structures, but if an area is too dark, the light wont illuminate everything. This creates a mechanic where the player can see that there is light in the distance, but must get closer to see what the light covers.</p>
