                    <!-- <p>On this page you can take a look at my personal favorite projects among the best of my best works and see the tech stacks I used to create them! My work is a reflection of my journey as a developer, 
                        and I'm always looking to learn and grow. I have experience in a variety of programming languages and technologies, and I am excited to share my projects with you.</p> -->
                    <h3>~The Journey~</h3>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>I started my coding journey on Scratch when I was 11 years old.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I would spend all of my free time after school playing around with the website's block codeing framework. Experimenting to make anything from games to silly animations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="emphasise">In highschool</span> I took up a programming class which taught me everything I needed to start my Python coding journey.
                        I would start with basic prompt-and-answer programs with varying logic. 
                        Working with what I had and wanting to do something bigger with my new skills I would, in my first year, make use of ascii text art and complex math algorithms to create a full on golf game 
                        playable just from the player’s terminal. That year, I won an award for my innovation and creativity put into this complex game.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="emphasise">My second year</span> I fully realised my passion not just for coding but for making complex interactive systems, deeply thought out mechanics, and fun and user-friendly user interfaces 
                        as I would develop dozens of shorter but inspired games that I saw as a chance to experiment with as many uses of Python and Pygame capabilities as possible.
                        One of my most notable games being a rocketship-themed game where the goal centered around collecting points and surviving as long as possible.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="emphasise">My third year,</span> the practicum class, would be the year I joined my school’s IT team officially as an intern 
                        which meant I would help with day to day tasks such as keeping up with the school’s cyber security ensuring students use Chromebooks ethically. 
                        As part of this team I was also heavily involved in larger scale projects such as designing and assembling an electronically accessed storage cabinet for students to store school-issued Chromebooks overnight. 
                        This was also the year of my largest and most ambitious game yet, Living Planet, a platformer game for which I designed my own engine, textures, animation, and music for.
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="emphasise">After Highschool,</span> the decision of what I wanted for my career had been well set in. 
                        I had video game development and hardware integration down and yet I still wanted to branch out the spread of my knowledge. 
                        This is when I sought out a trade school to teach me about the parts of software development I still knew little about, web and app development.
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="emphasise">In trade school,</span> I really tested myself. It was the first time I had been a part of a team of people that were much older and more experienced than me. 
                        Despite my relative inexperience, my insatiable appetite for learning and drive to excel would impress my classmates and eventually aid me in graduating the school with an A+ grade overall.
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="emphasise">Today,</span> my passion blooms more furiously than ever before. For all kinds of development, software and hardware, frontend and backend.  
                        I’m filled with nothing but ideas and dreams for projects I used to believe I would never be smart enough to create. 
                        Now I feel as though there is nothing I can’t do given the time to figure it out. 
                        My freetime is always filled with developing my newest project, I’m never bored.
                        
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My goal for this website is serve as a place for anyone, hiring or not, to learn more about my professional life 
                        and to prove that I take my work seriously and take pride in it. This website is a place for people who are willing to take a deeper look at me than a one page resume. 
                        For me to get excited and write about the projects I work on and for me to remind myself that that I can do anything.</p>
