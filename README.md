This is my personal, official portfolio website. This site is a place for anyone from employers to enjoyers to view the following:

 - My full resume featuring extra information, styling, interactivity, and a downloadable PDF version.
 - A comprehensive list of my best works following a recap of my coding journey thus far as well as where to find each project.
 - In-depth reviews of said projects with details such as how it was made, my inspiration, and graphics depicting everything from previews to behind the scenes. (Not yet finished.)
 - A list of recommendations, awards, and references from previous employers, teachers, and coworkers. (Not yet added.)
 - A quick-message system for ease of access and to invite collaboration with other contact information available on the site.

 Please feel free to reach out with offers, collaboration requests, or any suggestions on how I can improve this page. I welcome new connections!

 I look forward to hearing from you! :]
