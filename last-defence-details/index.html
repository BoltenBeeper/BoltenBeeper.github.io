                        <p>This is a space game I made for school originally called Star Battles, with the new update came a name change. The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible before the time runs out. Any score 0 or below is considered a loss, and a score above that counts as a win. Right now the time limit is short for show, but in the final version it will be extended.</p>

                        <p class="info-description"><span class="info-hook">EPIC GAMEPLAY</span>This is not a comlex game by any means. Gameplay in this game consists of moving your ship left to right to avoid hitting asteroids and losing 3 hits of health and shooting as many as possible for 100 points each. If an asteroid gets past you lose 100 points. There are 3 shot types, normal, (quick, small) big, (slower recharge) and a literal screen wipe that destroys most if not all asteroids (very long recharge.)</p>

Not only does this increase replay value, but it means you can challenge yourself and friends to beat your highscore. With the feature of unlocking multiple ship types as you play and the fact that each one gains more points, beating your own score becomes a sort of progression that feels even more earned.</p>

Ships effect gameplay, with each ship changing the amount of points you get for each asteroid pop. Accessories cause purely cosmetic differences, meaning that they have no effect on gameplay, but can change things like what your bullets look like and sound effects in the game.</p>

The basic blue ship grants 100 points per asteroid pop. The green ship will generate 150 points per pop. The red ship doubles the amount of points of the blue ship at 200 per pop. Finally, the gold ( Infinity Gauntlet ) ship matches the red ships big penis energy with 200 points per pop except this time it causes each asteroid to drop a gold coin which can be picked up for an EXTRA 200 POINTS?!? AWAAHHH??</p>
