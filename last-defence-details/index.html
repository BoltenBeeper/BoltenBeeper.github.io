                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <div class="summary-content">
                        <p>Last Defence is a fairly simple spaceship game where your goal is to shoot an endless wave of asteroids to gain points. Any amount of points above zero is a win so the challenge lies in beating your previous or friend's scores. This game is intended as an arcade cabinet-style, replayable game with a focus on progression and fun.<br><br>
                            Aside from its repeatable gameplay element this game offers silly gimmicks from its cosmetic option variety to easter eggs. What those are I'll leave you to discover for yourself.<br><br>
                            This game was one of the first projects outside of Scratch that I felt I had the space to get creative. Being my final game for my second high school year of coding, I had much more time to invest into it.<br><br>
                            Looking back, it's incredibly primitive and far from my most ambitious game or project to come out of that era, yet to this day it serves as a personal reminder to me what having fun with game development looks like. For that reason, preserving it as something to always have and look back on is important to me.

Gameplay in this game consists of moving your ship left to right to avoid hitting asteroids and losing 3 hits of health and shooting as many as possible for 100 points each. If an asteroid gets past you lose 100 points. There are 3 shot types, normal, (quick, small) big, (slower recharge) and a literal screen wipe that destroys most if not all asteroids (very long recharge.)</p>

Not only does this increase replay value, but it means you can challenge yourself and friends to beat your highscore. With the feature of unlocking multiple ship types as you play and the fact that each one gains more points, beating your own score becomes a sort of progression that feels even more earned.</p>

The basic blue ship grants 100 points per asteroid pop. The green ship will generate 150 points per pop. The red ship doubles the amount of points of the blue ship at 200 per pop. Finally, the gold ( Infinity Gauntlet ) ship matches the red ship's big penis energy with 200 points per pop except this time it causes each asteroid to drop a gold coin which can be picked up for an EXTRA 200 POINTS?!?
